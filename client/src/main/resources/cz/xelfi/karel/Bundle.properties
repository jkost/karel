DESC_00=<p>I need your help!</p>\
        <p>I'm robot Karla, and I got lost in this building. My navigation \
           circuits are broken, so I cannot navigate properly.</p>\
        <p>Could you please use the commands, and guide me to the exit?</p>
HINT_00=Use the 'turn-left' and 'move' commands to move Karla to the exit.
DESC_01=<p>Uff, thanks for helping me to get out of the room.</p>\
        <p>I am in another room now. I am afraid I'll need your help \
        to get out of not only this room, but to get through a series \
        of rooms, to get out of this building.</p>\
        <p>Also, there's a lot of interference here, I'm afraid \
        you cannot give me commands one by one anymore. I'll need you to \
        provide me a list of command I can follow.</p>\
        <p>Luckily, some of my sight is still preserved, despite the \
        interference, so it will be enough to ensure I am standing next \
        to the exit, and facing it.</p>
HINT_01=Note the exit is behind Karla. Turn her so that she faces back. Do \
        it by doing to left turn. Fill the commands in the pre-created \
        'turn-back' command, and press GO!
DESC_02=Ufff, thanks! Another room, the same task as last time - \
        can you please turn me so that I face the exit?
HINT_02=Note the exit is to the right of Karla. But, Karla does not have \
        a command to turn right, only to turn left. Turning right is the \
        same as turning left three times. Define the command so that it will turn \
        Karla left three times. Or, even better, define the command by reusing the \
        'turn-back' command from the previous room: turn right is the same as \
        turning back and then turning left.
DESC_03=<p>Ohhh, another room! Thanks for your help so far!</p>\
         <p>I am afraid the interference is getting worse. My sight is \
         very impaired now. I am sure it will get better when I get out \
         of this building. But, for now, I'm afraid I'll need you to \
         provide me instructions to reach the exit, not only to stand next to it.</p>
HINT_03=The exit is two rows ahead of Karla. Just define the command so that Karla \
        moves twice.
DESC_04=Thanks for guiding me through that room! Can you guide me \
        through this room as well?
HINT_04=This is similar to the previous room - Karla just needs to go forward. \
        The difference now is that the exit is far away. Instead of specifying \
        the move command 6 times, use the 'repeat' command to repeat the 'move' \
        command 6 times.
DESC_05=<p>Uff, that's another room behind me, thanks!</p>\
        <p>Please help he through this room as well!</p>
HINT_05=<p>In this room, Karla needs to go straight for a bit, then turn right, \
        and the go straight for a bit more. Please use the 'turn-right' command \
        that you defined before to turn right.</p>\
        You could also observe that Karla in both cases needs to go exactly \
        6 steps - we have a command for that, why not use it?</p>
DESC_06=<p>That was good, thank you for walking me through!</p>\
        <p>We've got another problem, I'm afraid: the interference is \
        more intensive across next few rooms. Would you please provide \
        me instructions that will guide me through them?</p>
HINT_06=<p>Karla needs to go straight for a bit, then turn right, \
        and the go straight for a bit more. Unlike previous cases, there are multiple \
        rooms now, and the same instructions must work for all of them. \
        Note that Karla cannot step into a wall - she could scratch herself. \
        Please use the is wall condition to walk until the wall is right \
        in front of her, and then turn. There's no need to stop at exit, \
        Karla will walk through it on her own.</p>
DESC_99=<p>Hurray, I am out now. Thanks for freeing me up!</p>\
        <p>Feel free to give me some commands to walk around!.</p>
